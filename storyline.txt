# Storyline

## Driver Insights
create_lap_time_consistency(): Purpose: Analyzes the consistency of lap times for the top 10 finishers.
create_sector_heatmap(): Purpose: visualizes the average performance of the top 15 drivers across three race sectors (S1, S2, S3)
create_pace_evolution(): Purpose: Shows how the lap times of the top 5 finishers evolved throughout the race
create_best_laps_comparison(): Purpose: Compares the average of the best 10 laps for the top 15 fastest drivers.
create_performance_frontier(): Purpose: Analyzes driver style/performance by comparing corner entry vs. corner exit times ("Driver DNA").
create_micro_sector_heatmap(): Purpose: Similar to the sector heatmap but for finer "micro-sectors" to analyze cornering performance.
create_pace_ema_comparison(alpha=0.2): Purpose: Compares the race pace trend of the top 5 finishers using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to smooth out lap-by-lap noise
create_lap_time_consistency_driver(target_driver): Purpose: Compares a specific driver's consistency against the field average
create_sector_comparison_driver(target_driver): Purpose: Compares a specific driver's average sector times against the field average
create_pace_evolution_driver(target_driver): Purpose: Compares a specific driver's pace evolution against the field's median pace.
create_best_laps_comparison_driver(target_driver): Purpose: Compares a specific driver's "Best 10 Laps Average" against the field's average of that same metric

## Paddock
create_pace_degradation_comparison(N_drivers=5): To compare the "Pace Drop-off" (Tire Degradation) of the top finisher
create_coeff_field_rank():Goal: To rank the entire field based on their tire management
create_pace_degradation_comparison_driver(driver_number): To benchmark the selected driver's pace trend against the "Field Average" trend
create_coeff_field_rank_driver(driver_number): To highlight where the selected driver sits in the overall tire degradation ranking

## Checkered Flag
create_weather_timeline(): To visualize how weather conditions changed over the course of the race.
create_wind_polar(): To show the prevailing wind speed and direction
create_top_finishers: Shows the top race finishers by time
create_fastest_lap_distribution(): To visualize the temporal distribution of peak performance across the entire field. It answers the question: "At what point in the race is the track closest to its optimal condition, or when represent the drivers pushing hardest?"
create_dnf_analysis(): To analyze vehicle reliability and race completion rates. It creates a "Survivability" chart showing which cars failed to finish and how long they lasted.
